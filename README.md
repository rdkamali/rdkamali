During my 12 years of experience in mobile and web application design and development, I have been involved in all stages of design and development.
Worked in an Agile environment, worked extensively with scrum methodologies for at least 7 years.
I am very interested in the field of software development and Recommended systems, and I would appreciate the opportunity to move forward in this field with a great team in a progressive environment.
I’m a hard worker, honest, enthusiastic, highly motivated, flexible to work with any technology and welcome changes and have lots of plans in my mind.

🏡 I’m living in Bucharest, Romania.
